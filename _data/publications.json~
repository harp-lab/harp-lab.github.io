Such engines form the backbone of modern high-throughput applications in static analysis, network monitoring, and social-media mining. In this paper, we present a methodology for implementing a modern in-memory Datalog engine on data center GPUs, allowing us to achieve significant (up to 45\texttimes{}) gains compared to Souffl\'{e} (a modern CPU-based engine) on context-sensitive points-to analysis of httpd. We present GPUlog, a Datalog engine backend that implements iterated relational algebra kernels over a novel range-indexed data structure we call the hash-indexed sorted array (HISA). HISA combines the algorithmic benefits of incremental range-indexed relations with the raw computation throughput of operations over dense data structures. Our experiments show that GPUlog is significantly faster than CPU-based Datalog engines, while achieving favorable memory footprint compared to contemporary GPU-based joins.},\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 1},\n pages = {762â€“776}, \n numpages = {15},\n keywords = {analytic databases, datalog, gpu},\n location = {Rotterdam, Netherlands},\n series = {ASPLOS '25}\n }"
